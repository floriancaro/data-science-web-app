# Oyatoi - Web App for Data on Hired Foreigners

A data science web app that visualizes a data set on hired foreigners during the Meiji era in Japan. The web app complements my research work compiling this data set from various sources including the 『資料御雇外国人』 by the Centre for East Asian Cultural Studies for UNESCO.

Created using Streamlit and Python.

Based on the Coursera Guided Project "Build a Data Science Web App with Streamlit and Python".
